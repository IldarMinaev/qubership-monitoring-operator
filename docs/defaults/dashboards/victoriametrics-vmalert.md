| Top 10 rules by produced samples ($group) | Shows the top 10 recording rules which generate the most of samples. Each generated sample is basically a time series which then ingested into configured remote storage. Rules with high numbers may cause the most pressure on the remote database and become a source of too high cardinality. |                                                       |        |
| Rules with 0 produced samples ($group)    | Shows the rules which do not produce any samples during the evaluation. Usually it means that such rules are misconfigured, since they give no output during the evaluation.<br/>Please check if rule's expression is correct and it is working as expected.                                      | Default:<br/>Mode: absolute<br/>Level 1: 80<br/><br/> |        |

| Memory usage ($instance) | Amount of used memory<br/><br/>Resident memory shows share which can be freed by OS when needed.<br/><br/>Anonymous shows share for memory allocated by the process itself. This share cannot be freed by the OS, so it must be taken into account by OOM killer.<br/><br/>If you think that usage is abnormal or unexpected, please file an issue and attach memory profile if possible.     |            |        |
| Open FDs ($instance)     | Panel shows the percentage of open file descriptors in the OS.<br/>Reaching the limit of open files can cause various issues and must be prevented.<br/><br/>See how to change limits here [https://medium.com/@muhammadtriwibowo/set-permanently-ulimit-n-open-files-in-ubuntu-4d61064429a](https://medium.com/@muhammadtriwibowo/set-permanently-ulimit-n-open-files-in-ubuntu-4d61064429a) |            |        |
